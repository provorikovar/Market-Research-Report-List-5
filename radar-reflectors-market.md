<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Radar Reflectors Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Octahedral Corner Reflector</li><li>Luneberg Lens</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Radar reflectors are crucial for enhancing visibility and safety at sea. Two common types in the market are octahedral corner reflectors and Luneberg lenses. Octahedral corner reflectors are compact and efficient, consisting of three mutually perpendicular dihedral angles that reflect radar signals back to the source. On the other hand, Luneberg lenses are spherical in shape and provide omni-directional reflection of radar signals, making them ideal for use in maritime and aviation applications. Both types play a vital role in improving detection capabilities and avoiding collisions.</p></p>
