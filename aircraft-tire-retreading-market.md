<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Aircraft Tire Retreading Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Pre-Cure</li><li>Mold-Cure</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Aircraft tire retreading is a cost-effective method of extending the lifespan of tires. There are two main types of retreading processes in the market: Pre-Cure and Mold-Cure. In Pre-Cure retreading, a new tread rubber is applied to the tire casing and then cured in a mold. This process allows for a higher degree of customization and flexibility in tread design. On the other hand, Mold-Cure retreading involves applying a raw rubber tread directly to the casing, which is then shaped and cured in a mold. This process is known for its durability and ability to withstand harsh operating conditions.</p></p>
