<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Lysimeter Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Weighing Type</li><li>Non-weighing Type</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Lysimeter market types include weighing type and non-weighing type. Weighing type lysimeters measure the amount of water that moves through the soil by weighing the lysimeter and monitoring changes in weight over time. Non-weighing type lysimeters, on the other hand, estimate water movement based on parameters such as evapotranspiration and soil moisture content without directly measuring weight. Both types of lysimeters are important tools for studying water movement in soil and can be used in various research and agricultural applications.</p></p>
