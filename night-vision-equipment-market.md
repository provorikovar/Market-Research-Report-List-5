<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Night Vision Equipment Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Image Intensifier</li><li>Thermal Image</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Night vision equipment is divided into two main types: image intensifiers and thermal imaging. Image intensifiers work by amplifying ambient light to provide a clearer image in low light conditions. This technology is commonly used in night vision goggles and scopes. On the other hand, thermal imaging detects heat signatures emitted by objects to create a visual representation of the environment. This technology is often used in military and law enforcement applications, as well as in hunting and outdoor recreation. Both types of night vision equipment play a crucial role in providing enhanced visibility in dark or low light settings.</p></p>
