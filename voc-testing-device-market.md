<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The VOC Testing Device Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>PID</li><li>Metal-oxide Semiconductor</li></ul></p>
<p><p>VOC Testing Devices utilize different technologies to detect and measure volatile organic compounds in the environment. Two common types are PID (photoionization detector) and Metal-oxide Semiconductor sensors. PID devices work by ionizing gas molecules to measure VOC concentration, while Metal-oxide Semiconductor sensors operate by detecting changes in electrical conductivity. Each type has its own strengths and weaknesses, with PID devices being more sensitive to a wider range of VOCs and Metal-oxide Semiconductor sensors being more cost-effective and durable. Both play a crucial role in environmental monitoring and industrial safety.</p></p>
