<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Carbon Cathode Block for Aluminium Smelting Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Graphitic Cathodes</li><li>Graphitized Cathodes</li><li>Others</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Carbon cathode blocks for aluminum smelting market types can be categorized into three main segments: graphitic cathodes, graphitized cathodes, and others. Graphitic cathodes are made from a mixture of petroleum coke and coal tar pitch, providing high electrical conductivity and thermal stability. Graphitized cathodes undergo a further heat treatment process to increase their density and improve performance. The "others" category includes alternative types of carbon cathode blocks that may have different properties or manufacturing processes compared to graphitic and graphitized cathodes.</p></p>
