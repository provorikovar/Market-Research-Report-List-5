<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Liquified Natural Gas Carrier Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Self-supporting Type</li><li>Film Type</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The Liquified Natural Gas Carrier market consists of two main types: Self-supporting Type and Film Type. Self-supporting Type carriers utilize a membrane containment system that is self-supporting, allowing for greater flexibility in design and construction. Film Type carriers, on the other hand, utilize a containment system where the LNG cargo is held in an independent membrane within the ship's hull. Both types offer unique benefits and are chosen based on a combination of factors such as capacity, cost-effectiveness, and safety considerations in the LNG transportation industry.</p></p>
