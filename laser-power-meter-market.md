<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Laser Power Meter Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Thermopile Detectors</li><li>Photodiode Detectors</li><li>Pyroelectric Energy Sensors</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Laser power meters are devices used to measure the power of laser beams. There are three main types of laser power meters: thermopile detectors, photodiode detectors, and pyroelectric energy sensors. Thermopile detectors work by absorbing the laser power and converting it to heat, which is then measured. Photodiode detectors convert the incoming laser power directly into an electrical current. Pyroelectric energy sensors generate an electrical signal in response to laser power, based on changes in temperature. Each type has its own strengths and limitations for specific applications.</p></p>
