<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Activated Carbon for Water Treatment Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Powder</li><li>Particles</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Activated carbon is commonly used in water treatment to remove impurities and contaminants from water. There are two main types of activated carbon used in water treatment: powder and particles. Powdered activated carbon has a smaller particle size, making it ideal for adsorption of contaminants in water. Particle activated carbon, on the other hand, has larger particles that are used in filters for physical removal of impurities. Both types have specific applications in water treatment processes to ensure clean and safe drinking water.</p></p>
