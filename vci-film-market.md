<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The VCI Film Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>VCI Stretch Film</li><li>VCI Shrink Film</li></ul></p>
<p><p>VCI film, or volatile corrosion inhibitor film, is a type of packaging material used to protect metal components from corrosion during storage and transportation. There are two main types of VCI film on the market: VCI stretch film and VCI shrink film. VCI stretch film is a flexible and elastic material that can be wrapped around metal products to provide a barrier against moisture and corrosive elements. VCI shrink film, on the other hand, is a heat-shrinkable material that conforms tightly to the shape of the metal item, providing a secure and protective covering.</p></p>
