<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The In-Line Magnetic Flowmeter Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>DC Magnetic Flowmeter</li><li>Induction Magnetic Flowmeter</li></ul></p>
<p><p>In-line magnetic flowmeters are typically categorized into two main types: DC magnetic flowmeters and Induction magnetic flowmeters. DC magnetic flowmeters operate on the principle of Faraday's Law of electromagnetic induction, measuring flow based on the voltage generated by the movement of conductive fluid through a magnetic field. In contrast, Induction magnetic flowmeters use AC voltage to generate a magnetic field, allowing for more precise measurements of flow rate in various industrial applications. Both types offer reliable and accurate flow measurement solutions for different industries.</p></p>
