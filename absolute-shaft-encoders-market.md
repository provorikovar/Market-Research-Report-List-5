<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Absolute Shaft Encoders Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Multi-Turn</li><li>Single-Turn</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Absolute shaft encoders are of two types: Multi-Turn and Single-Turn. Multi-Turn encoders can measure both the number of rotations as well as the angular position within each rotation, providing a more precise measurement. Single-Turn encoders, on the other hand, measure only the angular position within one rotation. Multi-Turn encoders are used in applications where high accuracy and precision are required over multiple rotations, while Single-Turn encoders are suitable for applications that only require position feedback within a single rotation.</p></p>
